# HTML-CSS-Projects-
 A collection of webpages made with HTML & CSS to learn basic web development skills. <br>
 My main objective is to use these webpages as a playground to learn, practice and improve HTML/CSS and JS skills.<br>

-Livram Acasa project is the only webpage where I have used JS. The aim here was to learn data structure, module pattern design and OOP basics.<br>
 Also, I have been using <a href='https://edabit.com/user/9LDTSLezN3xk4hpAx' target='_blank'>Edabit</a> for solving JavaScript challenges which was of great help in learning how to handle functions.<br>
-All the other projects were built solely with HTML & CSS. The intention was to learn and handle well all the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.<br>
