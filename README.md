# HTML-CSS-Projects-
A collection of webpages made with HTML &amp; CSS to learn basic web development skills.
My main objective is to use these webpages as playground to learn, practice and improve HTMl/CSS and JS skills.

   -Livram Acasa project is the only webpage where I have used JS. The aim here was to learn data structure, module pattern design and OOP basics.
    -Beside the above mentioned project, all the other projects were build solely with HTML &amp; CSS. The intention was to learn and handle well all the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
